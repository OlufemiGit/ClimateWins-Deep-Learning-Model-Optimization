# ClimateWins: Machine Learning with Python
## Deep Learning, Hyperparameter Optimization & Model Evaluation

## Project Overview
This repository focuses on building, optimizing, and evaluating advanced machine learning models using European climate data.

## The emphasis is on:
- Implementing neural network architectures using Keras
- Comparing deep learning models with traditional supervised learning models
- Evaluating model performance using structured metrics
- Applying hyperparameter optimization techniques
- Visualizing training behavior and performance outcomes

## The objectives are to:
- Build complex neural network models using Keras
- Implement CNN architectures for structured weather pattern detection
- Develop RNN and LSTM models for sequential climate data
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance
- Evaluate models using loss curves, accuracy metrics, and confusion matrices
- Compare performance across model types

## Models Implemented
  **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
  **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
  **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
  **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
  **Random Forest (Optimization Focus)**

 ## Hyperparameter Optimization
 Experiments conducted include:
   - Learning rate adjustments
   - Epoch variations
   - Activation function comparison
   - Batch size experimentation
   - Tree depth and estimator variation (Random Forest)
  
Performance differences were analyzed and documented.

 ## Hyperparameter Optimization
   - Accuracy scoring
   - Confusion matrices
   - Training and validation loss curves
   - Overfitting vs underfitting analysis
   - Performance comparison across model architectures

## Hyperparameter Optimization
  - Python
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow / Keras

## Key Technical Insights
 - Neural networks capture nonlinear climate relationships more effectively than linear models.
 - CNN architectures improve pattern extraction from structured datasets.
 - RNN/LSTM models better handle sequential weather dependencies.
 - Model performance is highly sensitive to hyperparameter selection.
 - Proper tuning significantly reduces overfitting and improves generalization.

## Limitations Observed
 - Deep learning models require careful parameter calibration.
 - Sequential models increase computational cost.
 - Performance varies depending on data preprocessing and scaling.
 - Climate systems introduce inherent modeling uncertainty.

## Recommendations
   **ClimateWins should:**
 - Combine Random Forest (for interpretability), CNN (for pattern recognition), and LSTM (for temporal forecasting).
 - Prioritize LSTM for long-term weather trend forecasting and detecting evolving abnormal patterns.
 - Use CNN for detecting extreme weather classifications and identifying spatial or structured anomalies.
 - Formalize hyperparameter tuning process by implementing systematic hyperparameter tuning pipelines for deep learning and validation-based early stopping
 - Implement cross-validation for all models by using K-Fold cross-validation and applying stratified sampling where appropriate
